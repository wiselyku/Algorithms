# Question 20
## T9
On old cell phones, users typed on a numeric keypad and the phone would provide a list of words that matched these numbers. Each digit mapped to a set of 0-4 letters. Implement an algorithm to return a list of matching words, given a sequence of digits. You are provided a list of valid words (provided in whatever data structure you'd like). The mapping is shown in the diagram below:
1 --> null
2 --> abc
3 --> def
4 --> ghi
5 --> jkl
6 --> mno
7 --> pqrs
8 --> tuv
9 --> wxyz
0 --> null
